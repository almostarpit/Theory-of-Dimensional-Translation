## 📚 Abstract
This theory proposes a dimensional perspective to explain the strange quantum behavior of electrons — particularly in the double slit experiment. It hypothesizes that the electron, being a dimensionless (0D) entity, interacts with higher-dimensional environments in ways that produce quantum effects such as superposition, wavefunction behavior, and observation-induced collapse.

## 🌀 Introduction: Time and Dimensions

Imagine a ball placed at rest on a table. If moved one foot away, its position has shifted spatially. But if we reverse time, it returns to its original position. This implies that with time as a fourth axis, the ball's presence shifts not only in space, but also along this time dimension. This forms the intuitive basis of 4D thinking — an object not just moving through time, but with time.

## 🔸 The Nature of the Electron

An electron is typically treated as a point particle — having no spatial volume or shape. In this sense, it may be best described as a **0-dimensional (0D)** object. Unlike higher-dimensional objects, a 0D entity does not possess length, area, or volume. This may give it the theoretical ability to interact with multiple dimensional states.

## 🧱 Analogy: The Empty Land

Think of an empty piece of land. It has no defined use until shaped by someone — maybe a hut, maybe a mansion. A 0D object like the electron may similarly be "shaped" by the dimensional environment it interacts with.

## 🧪 Double Slit Experiment — A Dimensional Explanation

In the double slit experiment, a single electron produces an interference pattern — as if it went through **both slits** simultaneously. But when observed, it behaves like a particle going through **one slit**.

This theory suggests:
- The electron’s 0D nature frees it from 3D rules.
- It interacts across timelines — going through **both slits in different timelines**.
- We, being 3D beings, cannot distinguish these timelines.
- So, we **perceive both outcomes at once** — an illusion of wave-like behavior.

## 👁️ Observation: Why the Behavior Changes

When observed:
- The electron must interact with a **3D object** (detector).
- It can no longer remain hidden or 0D.
- It “translates” into a 3D version — so we can perceive it.
- Thus, **observation collapses the wavefunction**, not by consciousness, but by **dimensional translation.**

## 🌊 Wavefunction as a Stack of Timelines

Instead of mere probability, this theory suggests:
> The wavefunction represents the same electron, existing across many slightly different timelines — stacked together.

We can’t separate them — so the electron appears as a **spread-out wave**.

## ✅ Conclusion

This theory reframes quantum weirdness as a result of:
- Dimensional mismatch (0D electrons, 3D observers)
- Timeline jumping due to lack of dimensional anchoring
- Perceptual illusions of reality

## ✍️ Author's Note

This theory is a conceptual and speculative attempt to bridge quantum behavior and dimensional thinking. It was written independently by **Arpit Mishra**, a student from Prayagraj, India — passionate about physics, astronomy, and the mysteries of the universe.
